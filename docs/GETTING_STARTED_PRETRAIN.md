# Getting Started for Point Cloud Pre-training

Please download and preprocess the point cloud datasets according to the [dataset guidance](GETTING_STARTED_DB.md)

## :fire: News of Our 3D Pre-training Study
- We are actively exploring the possibility of boosting the **3D pre-training generalization ability**. The AD-PT pre-training code is **coming soon** in 3DTrans-v0.2.0. (updated on Sep. 2023).
- 3DTrans has supported the Autonomous Driving Pre-training using the [PointContrast](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10985) 
<!-- - We are exploring the scalable pre-training solution by continuously increasing the scales of 3D pre-training data, and if you are interested in this topic, do not hesitate to contact me (bo.zhangzx@gmail.com). -->

## Pre-training using AD-PT on ONCE

**Note that** you can find in [once dataset yaml](../tools/cfgs/dataset_configs/once/OD/once_dataset_vehicle.yaml) that, we use the **once_infos_train_vehicle.pkl** and **once_infos_val_vehicle.pkl**, which are generated by merging the the 'Car', 'Bus', 'Truck' classes into the 'Vehicle' classes.

You can download the once_infos_train_vehicle.pkl and once_infos_val_vehicle.pkl here: [once_infos_val_vehicle](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Doku6CPie3Y4Vc9o-vRgBi4aQ1cizkCf/view?usp=sharing) and [once_infos_train_vehicle](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d305H3v8AcuU716n_4-wdKVgqRh4FBDt/view?usp=sharing)
